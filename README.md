## About

This applications acts as a safe path prediction program for the city of Seattle. The project targets people in Seattle who primarily drive as their mode of transportation. Despite innovations in safety technology, driving remains a dangerous daily task. According to the CDC road crashes are a leading cause of death for people aged 1-54 (Global Road Safety, 2023). The app aims to provide an additional layer of safety through machine learning prediction and path finding. For ease of use, the application has an efficient, accessible, and engaging graphical user interface hosted on a web server. Here’s a run down of the main functionality: a user will input a source and destination. The program will use data such as the time of day, weather, and locations to predict a safety rating for the given path. Then the app will show the user directions for a safe and efficient path from the given locations.  

Efficiency, seamlessness, and upgradability are the system quality attributes I care about most for this project. A user should be able to efficiently complete their goal once they enter the application. Since the task is fairly simple, enter directions and receive a path, this should take no more than a minute. The different aspects of the program should be distinct programs with seamless integration: the UI, pathfinding algorithm, machine learning algorithm, and database. Furthermore, the programs should be cleanly written and free of bugs or code smells. Finally, the program is designed for continued work and upgrades beyond the scope of this course. Additional functionalities should be accounted and planned for such as new cities or the ability to find a safe walking path. Future iterations could include predicting safety for walking routes, adding in green spaces as a factor for walking routes, including more cities, etc.
